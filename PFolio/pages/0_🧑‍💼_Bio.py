    """
I am a strategic product executive who builds intelligent, scalable solutions at the intersection of 
**AI, Field Service, Digital Commerce, and Cloud SaaS**. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve guided global 
teams and complex enterprise programs across Oracle, HP, and high-growth SaaS environments—transforming 
ambiguity into strategy, and strategy into measurable business outcomes.

My work centers on designing high-impact platforms that unify **eCommerce, field service, data automation, 
and ERP ecosystems (Infor, Karmak, SAP, DST)**. I specialize in turning operational complexity into 
intuitive user experiences that accelerate revenue, reduce friction, and build customer trust.

With hands-on expertise in **Oracle Field Service (OFS/OFSC)**, AI-driven automation, and cloud integrations 
across AWS and Azure, I’ve delivered:

- **40–80 mins/day** technician productivity gain  
- **30+ day** reduction in billing cycles  
- **20%+** revenue uplift on commerce platforms  
- **80%+** customer retention across mid-market portfolios  

What drives me is building clarity, momentum, and purpose across engineering, design, sales, and customer 
success teams. I lead with empathy, analytical rigor, and a bias for action—ensuring every product decision 
delivers measurable business and customer value.

I believe great products don’t just solve problems; they **empower people, modernize organizations, and 
create long-term competitive advantage**.
